# CJS analysis of penguin chick survival

# Import data (all_covs_groups.inp) and convert it from the MARK inp file format to the \textbf{RMark}
# format using the function convert.inp 
# It is defined with 4 groups: Males in 1213, females in 1213, males in 1314, and females in 1314
# This structure is defined with the group.df argument of convert.inp.
